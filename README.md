# The Code Quiz!

This application is designed to be a quick, timed way for you to challenge your basic coding skills. The quiz is comprised of 6 multiple choice coding questions that you must answer correctly within the timeframe you've selected. You can choose between Easy mode - 90 seconds to complete the quiz, Medium mode - 60 seconds to complete it, or Hard - 45 seconds to complete it. Once the time runs out, you'll be able to see your score and ranking on the left hand leader board!

This quiz was mostly coded in Javascript and it was fairly difficult to code it in a way that was responsive to the user's quiz selections while making sure the correct text was shown on the screen. Choosing which text to display when and how, whether it was manipulating the DOM via Javascript or having it already laid out in HTML, was also difficult to think through and code while laying out and designing this quiz.

Make no mistake though... the hardest part was definitely coming up with the questions (;
